You can apply a filter to the second batch step to ensure it only processes records that didn’t fail during the first batch step.<br>By having batch steps accept only some records for processing, you streamline the batch job so the Mule runtime engine can focus only on the relevant data for a particular batch step.</p><p>A batch step uses two attributes to filter records:</p><p><strong>acceptExpression</strong></p><p><strong>acceptPolicy</strong></p><p>Each batch step can accept one <em>acceptExpression </em>and one <em>acceptPolicy </em>attributes to filter records.</p><p><strong>Use the <em>acceptExpression</em> attribute to process only records that evaluate to true; if the record evaluates to false, the batch step skips the record and sends it to the next one</strong>.
